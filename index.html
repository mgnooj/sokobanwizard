Sokoban Wizard is a retro-style “sokoban” game, where the player completes levels by strategically moving boxes to goals. (Sokoban means “warehouse employee” in Japanese.) The main game includes 14 levels of increasingly challenging Sokoban levels. Each tier of levels introduces a new game character with a different mechanic — including Shadow, who duplicates the player’s moves, and Twin, who does the opposite. Levels can be skipped and replayed at any point. Furthermore, there is a high score feature which counts the number of moves the player used to solve a level.

The game also includes a full level editor, where players can create their own levels using all of the game assets and entities. Players can save these levels for replay and sharing with friends, complete with high score tracking and unlimited edits.
</p><p>
Best of all, the game is 100% ad-free and does not collect any user information.
</p><p>
Sokoban Wizard is a mind-warping, creatively empowering game experience for Sokoban masters and newcomers of all ages.
